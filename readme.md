# These Are The Droids You Are Looking For

The main files of interest in this document are `fcnn.py`, `unet.py`, and `loss.py`.
The other files are scripts or jupyter notebooks for easy training or figure generation. 
Data is prepared using a series of scripts in the `/data/` directory, but I haven't
made them very durable. If you actually want to run the code and encounter problems, feel
free to contact me directly.
